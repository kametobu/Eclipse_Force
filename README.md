Misinformation is a big problem on social media. How young students see the eclipse?
Our platform will launch them to the correct path, with verified source like NASA EYES 
and others content creators, informing and building a scientific mindset.
Studying eclipses is an opportunity not only to teach astronomy but to demystify it.

## Our experiment

We stablished a relationship with two business specialists, a physical education teacher that teaches young people, and an astronomer with expertise in telescopes, astrophotography and dissemination of scientific information.
With this roles we produced a hub that connects high level verified contents, like the articles on Nasa Api, confident youtube channels and functinal resources. These contents are shareable and easily integrated into normal school activities,
remotely or in place.
