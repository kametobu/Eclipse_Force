## SUMMARY
The Annular Eclipse of the Sun is a phenomenon shrouded in urban legends and mysticism. For a long time, we have seen a series of rumors and exoteric predictions associated with the eclipse.

## THE PROBLEM
With the rapid growth of the internet, in recent years we have seen a staggering increase in misinformation, fake news and conspiracy theories. Faced with this chaotic scenario, we need to fight for the future of our childs.

How do young students see the eclipse?

## OUR PERSPECTIVE IS EDUCATION
In face to join the high quality curated articles with the young learners, our platform will connect both: Scientific Content Producer and young teachers that pretend to use social network and internet to teach astronomy. Our api provide trustworthy news and images from Nasa, embed contents like the Eyes of Nasa for viewing the next eclipse and other information about eclipses based on website publications. The curation will be done by content producers and through web scraping in authorized sources.

### PARTNERS
Scientific Content Producer: Everybody with recognized authority credentials that produce scientifica content in internet, youtube influencers, writers and social media producers with focus on science and astronomy.

Teachers, pedagogues: Educators who intend to use internet in their classes, at school or in remote teaching.

### AUDIENCE
Young learners, elementary school students and curious investigative childs.

## THE SOLUTION
With the aim of teaching young students by launching them on the scientific path, our platform will guarantee the source of the information and encourage students to develop critical thinking with verified sources such as NASA and other content creators, informing and building a scientific mindset.

Studying eclipses provides an excellent opportunity to not only teach astronomy but also to demystify the subject, watch the sky, create mental models and validate your own hypotheses through observation.

Eclipses are fascinating celestial events that capture people's attention and curiosity. By using eclipses as a teaching tool, educators can engage students and the general public in learning about astronomy. This can help dispel misconceptions and foster a deeper understanding of the subject.

Furthermore, enabling educators, regardless of their prior knowledge, to transmit the wonders of astronomy in an engaging and educational way is essential. Astronomy is a vast and complex field, but with the right resources and support, educators can effectively communicate its concepts to their students. By providing accessible and user-friendly materials, your platform can empower educators to deliver astronomy education that is both informative and captivating.

Besides that, astronomy is a transversal tool, which can be worked together with other disciplines such as arts, letters, mathematics, geography and history.

Many aspects of our lives, including navigation, communication, and even weather forecasting, rely on our understanding of celestial objects and their interactions. By highlighting these connections, your platform can foster a greater appreciation for astronomy and its impact on society.

Overall, our platform's focus on unifying information from verified sources, using eclipses as a teaching tool, enabling educators, and showcasing the relevance of astronomy can contribute to combating misinformation and promoting scientific literacy.

## HOW THE SOLUTION WAS DEVELOPED
### THE ROLES
We bring together a multidisciplinary team so that one complements the other's skill. 

We defined the following roles to work in tune to make quick deliveries and collect feedback as quickly as possible. The information was fed back into the system, affecting all chains, from design to prototyping and delivery on github.

Scrum Master 
Designer
Front End developer
Back End developer
Specialist Content Producer
Specialista Educationalist
The Scrum Master protects protects the team by making sure that members do not commit to commitments beyond what they can fulfill within a Sprint. The Scrum Master facilitates the Scrum and becomes responsible for removing any obstacles observed by the team during these meetings.

The Designer is responsible to create the concept, producing an harmonic and integrated User Experience (UX) . Identifies the elements that unify the platform based on researches, immersion, emphaty and prototyping the use case journey. The Design System is a key part of achieving effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction.

The Front end developer was the executor who brings the project to life, unites the world of design with programming. This professional is responsible for putting into practice, through codes, the user experience that was designed. Your emphasis should be on accessibility, and security and in implementing the design system reliably and connecting the user experience to the backend system (data).

The Specialist in scientific content was responsible to curate the contents of high quality from Nasa apis,orientando o analista para produzir uma boa estratégia de captação de dados da api da nasa e de outras fontes credenciadas. Also with creation of informative content for the media, more especially for digital media, for a specific audience focused in Anullar Solar Eclipses next Octuber 14. The specialist suggest to create a partnership with other content producer and chanels.

The Educatationalist is responsible for coordinating the teaching and learning processes, investing in the student's development process, always aware that he, in fact, needs to learn. The educator had access to the students' real demands and contributed to the design of a solution that could be used in practice, by sharing links and projecting diagrams on the resources that the school provides.

The Data analyst is responsible for extracting insights and information relevant to making strategic decisions in the project. It can also act in the creation of data warehouse, operation, processing and storage of data. The analyst is an important bridge for the creation of Apis, Microservices and backend

### DOUBLE DIAMOND
Source: Double Diamond https://innovationenglish.sites.ku.dk/
We used the double diamond framework to create a workflow very fast focused in four steps:

- discover
- define
- developer
- deliver

The team was splitted in two parts

(discover define) designer + specialists

(developer deliver) developers + scrum master

### PROBLEM DEFINITION
As we had two experts, we set out to create a solution that would unite the content producer with the educator, given the difficulties of scientific dissemination in Brazil and the world and the absence of quality standards that are already prepared for the educator to use in the classroom.

### DESIGN THINKING
Prototyping was a fundamental idea in our process. Continuous learning has been adopted and contributes to high-quality deliveries

The source code is entirely available in github,

This document produces a guide to future work

### FUTURE WORK
We believe that we can implement the following improvements in the next phase of the project

1. Using web scrapping to help content creator filter information
2. Embedding other Nasa content available for use
3. Creating an eclipse calendar that predicts the parameters of upcoming eclipses for a given location
4. Studying gamification to involve young learners in learning process
5. Integrating with LMS (Learning Management System)
6. Improving the user experience with more responsive and accessibility focused libraries
